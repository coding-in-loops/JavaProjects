## Introduction
This repository showcases a variety of Java projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate specific programming concepts or solve particular problems, making this repository a valuable resource for learning and reference.

## Projects
### System Design Projects
- **KISSDesignPrinciple**: Example of the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) design principle.
- **SingletonDesignPattern**: Implementation of the singleton design pattern.
- **ProductFactory**: Implementation of the factory design pattern.
- **ClothingProduct**: Implementation of a factory design pattern.
- **ElectronicsProduct**: Another example of the factory design pattern.

### Other Projects
- **WatchlistApplication**: Spring MVC project with Thymeleaf for managing a watchlist.
- **ComplexPatternProgramming**: Pattern programming understanding and loops.
- **FactoryDesignPattern**: Various implementations of the factory design pattern.
- **GuessTheNumber**: Simple guessing game where a random number is guessed.
- **HeartPattern**: Understanding loops by making a heart pattern.
- **Polymorphism**: Examples of tight coupling and loose coupling in OOP.


## Usage Instructions
To use or run any of these projects, follow the instructions provided in each project's directory. Each project has its own set of instructions, prerequisites, and setup information.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:coding-in-loops/JavaProjects.git
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to work on:
cd JavaProjects/ProjectName
